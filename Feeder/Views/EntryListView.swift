///
/// Instead, the heavy fetch + projection + grouping runs on `DataReader` (a
/// `@ModelActor`, so on a background thread). The view holds
/// `[EntryListSection]` state whose rows are complete `EntryRowDTO` value
/// snapshots (issue #148) — each row renders from its DTO plus the
/// `FaviconStore` image; there is NO per-row `modelContext.model(for:)` and
/// NO `entry.feed` relationship fault on MainActor. Selection carries the
/// row's `PersistentIdentifier`; `ContentView` resolves the ONE full `Entry`
/// per selection at the detail boundary.
///
/// **The `List` stays mounted across reloads (issue #146).** The old shape
/// swapped `ProgressView` ↔ `List` on a `hasLoaded` boolean, so every
/// structural reload destroyed and rebuilt the entire row tree — an
/// O(all-rows) view-list construction + layout that was the measured
/// `structural-reload` tail (p90 915 ms, max 1.9 s). Now `fetchPhase`
/// (`FetchPhase`, pure domain) feeds `entryListDisplayState(...)`, and the
/// pending window renders the SAME mounted `List` with zero rows — a calm
/// blank pane — so a resolved fetch applies as an incremental diff.
/// "No Articles" is asserted only by a RESOLVED empty fetch, never during
/// `pending` (the relocated #137 protection) and never while rows exist.
///
/// **Live updates**: lost compared to `@Query` auto-refresh. Replaced by
/// explicit refresh-version triggers driven from `ContentView` — `.onChange`
/// handlers on `syncEngine.isSyncing` / `classificationEngine.isClassifying`
