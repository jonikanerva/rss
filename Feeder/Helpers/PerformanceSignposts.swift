// MARK: - Shared OSSignposter

/// Shared `OSSignposter` for click → render intervals at hot UI boundaries.
///
/// The subsystem matches the rest of the app per `docs/stack.md → Logging`,
/// and the category is the system-recognised `.pointsOfInterest` so
/// Instruments surfaces these intervals under the default "Points of
/// Interest" lane (Logging template) without any extra configuration.
///
/// `OSSignposter` produces zero work when no profiler is attached, so the
/// begin/end calls ride for free in shipping builds — no `#if DEBUG` gating.
/// `nonisolated` so it is callable from any actor context (the detail-pane
/// render path crosses MainActor and a detached task).

// MARK: - Interval names

/// Named entry points for the three click → render intervals we instrument.
///
/// Static strings live in a single namespace so Instruments shows stable,
/// legible labels in the Points of Interest lane and renames stay in one
/// place if the surfaces are reshuffled. See `ContentView` for sidebar
/// and article intervals; `EntryDetailView` for the detail render interval.
