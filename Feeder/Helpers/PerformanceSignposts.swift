// MARK: - Shared OSSignposter

/// Shared `OSSignposter` for click → render intervals at hot UI boundaries.
///
/// The subsystem matches the rest of the app per `docs/stack.md → Logging`,
/// and the category is the system-recognised `.pointsOfInterest` so
/// Instruments surfaces these intervals under the default "Points of
/// Interest" lane (Logging template) without any extra configuration.
///
/// `OSSignposter` produces zero work when no profiler is attached, so the
/// begin/end calls ride for free in shipping builds — no `#if DEBUG` gating.
/// `nonisolated` so it is callable from any actor context (the detail-pane
/// render path crosses MainActor and a detached task).

/// Sibling logger used only to flag mis-paired signpost intervals — a begin
/// taken while a previous begin was still un-ended. The misuse is recorded as
/// a debug-level entry so it surfaces under `os_log` filtering without
/// polluting production logs. Subsystem matches `perfSignposter` per
/// `docs/stack.md → Logging`; category is human-readable so the warnings are
/// easy to grep for in `log stream`.

/// and article intervals; `EntryDetailView` for the detail render interval.
