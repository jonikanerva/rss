/// Lifecycle of the article-list background fetch for the current structural
/// context (category / folder / filter / cutoff). Replaces the old boolean
/// `hasLoaded` with a tagged union (`CLAUDE.md → Architecture`) so "the fetch
/// has not resolved yet" is distinguishable from "the fetch resolved empty" —
/// the distinction that makes a false "No Articles" flash on a populated
/// category structurally unreachable (issue #146; this relocates the #137
/// protection from the "Sorting your articles" copy into the state machine).
nonisolated enum FetchPhase: Sendable, Equatable {
  /// A structural fetch is in flight; nothing is known about the new context yet.
  case pending
  /// The most recent structural or refresh fetch applied its result.
  case resolved
  /// The structural fetch failed with a store error (no retry — the shared
  /// coordinator blocks rather than throws under contention, so a throw is
  /// almost certainly persistent). Healed by any later successful refresh
  /// reload, or by re-selecting the category.

// MARK: - Display State

/// What the article-list pane shows, derived once per render by
/// `entryListDisplayState(phase:hasSections:isAuthFailed:isOffline:)`.

  /// Pending fetch with no rows yet: the mounted `List` renders zero rows —
  /// a calm blank pane, never a spinner and never "No Articles".

  /// Genuinely empty at rest — the store has no rows for this context.

/// Pure precedence rule for the article-list pane (issue #146).
///
/// Precedence, most binding first:
/// 1. `hasSections` → `.list` — continuity over blankness: fetched rows always
///    render, whatever the phase or sync-error family says.
/// 2. `.pending` → `.blank` — an unresolved fetch asserts nothing; showing
///    "No Articles" (or any empty-family pane) here would be a false claim
///    about a context we have not read yet (the relocated #137 protection).
/// 3. `.failed` → `.error` — a store read failure outranks the sync-error
///    family: "couldn't load" must not masquerade as "offline" or "empty".
/// 4. `isAuthFailed` → `.authFailed`, then `isOffline` → `.offline`, then
///    `.noArticles`.
///
/// Deliberately NO engine flags (`isClassifying` / `isSyncing`) in the
/// signature: a resolved-empty fetch means the store has no rows for this
/// context right now, and the deferred-bump drain channel re-fetches as
/// classification lands rows — so asserting emptiness is safe, and the pane
/// live-populates the moment the first article exists.

// MARK: - Window-refresh gate

/// Pure scheduling gate for the whole-window refresh channel (issue #163).
/// Placed here rather than in `EntryListPaging.swift` because it is
/// fetch-LIFECYCLE logic (it reads `FetchPhase`), not paging math.
///
/// A refresh may run only when ALL of:
/// 1. `resolvedKey == currentKey` — the loaded window belongs to the current
///    structural context. While a structural fetch owns the window
///    (`resolvedKey` is cleared in its synchronous prefix), refreshes stand
///    down; the resolve-flip re-keys the refresh task so an owed bump is
///    picked up the moment ownership returns — never dropped.
/// 2. `phase != .pending` — same ownership rule, belt-and-braces for the
///    window between the prefix and the key assignment.
/// 3. `refreshVersion != consumedVersion` — the bump has not already been
///    covered by a fetch. The structural task snapshots `refreshVersion`
///    immediately BEFORE its first-page fetch and assigns it on
///    resolve/failure, so a bump landing before the snapshot is (correctly)
///    treated as included in the fetched data, and a bump landing after it
///    stays owed.
///
/// `phase == .failed` deliberately passes (with matching key and an owed
/// version): a later bump must be able to heal a failed pane — the healing
/// contract the structural task documents.
